## Introduction
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds optional static typing to the language, allowing developers to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
